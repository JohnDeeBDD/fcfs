 * Given there is a pro and a free version
 * And given that the difference is that in the pro version, the user can migrate many posts
 * And given that to migrate a post requires many steps
 * Then in the free version the many steps will be controlled from the browser
 * And in the pro version, the many step will be controlled by the remote migrate-posts server
